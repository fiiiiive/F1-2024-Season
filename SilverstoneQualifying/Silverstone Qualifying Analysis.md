# Silverstone Qualifying 
Silverstone delivered once again in today's qualifying, giving us 3 British drivers filling the top 3 spots. As an American on Fourth of July weekend I was heppy to see Logan Sargeant make it into Q2, 
but for everyone else, the real story today was the Mercedes 1-2 in qualifying today. Much of the discussion this year has been regarding McLaren, Ferrari, and of course Red Bull, but Mercedes has been quietly 
hovering around at the top end of the grid and these last two races have been a big boost to them, and I believe that their high speed cornering and DRS effectiveness are the culprit. With George Russell sitting on pole with a time of 1:25.819, he will get to serve as our benchmark today, so
without further ado...
# Red Bull
It is impossible to talk about the last 2 seasons without mentioning Red Bull dominance. It's quite easy to forget that up until 3-4 races ago, they were still the team to beat on track, especially with Max Verstappen. 
But here we are. Mercedes, and specifically George Russell, has beaten them in qualifying by 4 tenths. However, before everyone starts with omens of Red Bull's downfall, it is worth mentioning that Max did suffer damage
on his first flying lap, which pretty much put the rest of his laps after that at a handicap. I believe that Max can fight back tomorrow and I believe that he will be in the fight for a win, and at the very least a podium. 
However, the data does show some interesting conclusions. Max kept pace with Russell in the slower first sector, up until Turn 4. He had a very obvious snap that ruined his exit onto the Wellington Straight, and by Turn 5 
he was about 1 tenth behind Russell. Max's damage seemed to limit his high speed cornering and top speed as Russell is able to carry more speed into Turns 1 and 2 and clears him in top speed at the end of the straight, 
whereas the biggest hits to Russell's delta were in corners under 125-150 kph. Silverstone however is a fast circuit, so Russell was able to bring back whatever time he lost in the slow corners onto the straights. 
For any part of the track above 200 kph (Copse, Becketts, and Stowe specifically) Russell is able to carry more speed throughout, and because Silverstone is a faster circuit, I believe that is what favored Mercedes 
over the damaged Red Bull. We saw many times however that the Red Bull team tends to favor race setups over the fastest qualifying setups so I am excited to see what an undamaged, race-trim Red Bull can do tomorrow.
# McLaren
The McLaren is a similar story to the Red Bull, in the sense that the Mercedes high speed cornering and top speed won out on the day. However there were two discoveries in the data that I found very interesting. First,
McLaren has better acceleration than the Mercedes, however worse top speed. When looking at the delta graph, one can notice 'U' shapes at intervals that line up with the straights. This tells us that the McLaren is getting
a better jump out of the corners while the Mercedes is catching it on the straights. Secondly, the difference in top speeds is alarming. The Mercedes is getting nearly 5-8 kph of top speed at the end of the two biggest straights, 
which is massive, especially since it does not come at the cost of their braking. They are still able to brake at the same points as their rivals and I believe that was key in today's qualifying.
