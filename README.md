# F1-2024-Season
My analysis for the 2024 season of Formula 1

# Season 2024
Formula 1 Testing is now over this past weekend and we are getting into race week. Without looking at the data, and with the possibility of sandbagging to hide true potential, I would say the ranking of the grid looks as such.

# Front of the pack
# Red Bull and Ferrari
Once again Red Bull and Ferrari seem to lead the pack in terms of total package. Red Bull seem to be the biggest sandbaggers, and most fans already have them pegged as heavy favorites. Everyone seems so comfortable with extremely radical changes and it feels
like every team in the paddock is going to be playing catch-up. Ferrari on the other hand look like the only competitor to rise up and 
actually challenge for victories. I doubt there will be many such challenges, but on their day I can see Ferrari taking the fight to Red Bull. Once we see the full extent of each package this upcoming weekend I will feel more comfortable to pass judgement on each. 

# Development Battle
# Mercedes-Aston Martin-McLaren
I am very excited about these three. All of them seem to be in a weird limbo between the midfield and podium contenders, and maybe even on a good weekend, one of these guys can pip a win off of the Red Bull or Ferrari. Watching this battle in the constructors is going to be extremely exciting. I feel it is going to come down to development. 
Mercedes seems comfortable where they are at. Not satisfied, but comfortable. The team is saying that they really nailed down a strong foundation of a car for them to build off of. I'm anxious to see what they do with that, because this sounds like the first time 
in the past few years that Mercedes seems proud of the work they did in the offseason. They seem to have a solid package going into the first round and I expect them to be higher up the order than McLaren at least, and close with Aston at least in the first round. 
And who knows? With well-developed upgrades I would be more than happy to throw them into the "Front of the Pack" tier later in the season. Aston Martin and McLaren are different stories however. Last year was the tale of two trajectories. Aston Martin started off with 
what I believe to be the second strongest package on the grid in 2022, and I see something similar here. They seem strong, possibly fighting with Mercedes, but if their development stagnates like it did last year, they will fall much further behind than they did last year.
They have the makings of a strong team, however without a solid upgrade schedule, they will surely drown. McLaren are a powerhouse when it comes to upgrades, and as the season goes on I can see them getting better and better. Their testing wasn't the most comforting however and it makes me wonder why they are so good at developing mid season, but they happen to be so off the pace at the start? I want to see this team up in the top tier, but at least after testing it feels like they will be playing catch-up.
This tightness of this trio poses a good amount of questions for these three. Did Mercedes finally figure out a solid foundation for them to upgrade from? Can Aston Martin develop effective upgrades efficiently? Will McLaren continue the ride the upwards trajectory that was started last year?
These questions make this an exciting group of teams to watch going into this season. 

# Lower Midfield
# Alpine-VCARB-Williams
I believe this group is going to be an exciting bunch as well, however just with much less at stake. I see them as fighting over table scraps near the bottom end of the points. This seems like it will play out similar to the aforementioned development battle. The VCARB-Red Bull relationship has been talked about so much, but I 
would genuinely be surprised if they are working as closely together as speculated. The VCARB car feels significantly different from the RB20, that's all. Should more allegations come out, I think that they should be investigated but at this point it all seems like speculation.
They have an exciting driver lineup, an exciting new livery (in my honest opinion), and seem poised to be near-regular points scorers. The Williams situation feels similar, however as of this moment they only have one driver. As an American, I love Logan Sargeant and wish him 
the absolute best this year, and if he can figure it out, no one will be happier than me. However, as of the time I am writing this, it feels hopeless. He scored no points on merit last year, and he was the first spin of testing this year. He is no Mazepin, but it is not 
promising from a rookie to look like he did. I believe that Albon will continue to fight for points, but without help from a teammate its going to be difficult to achieve much in the Constructors. Lastly, Alpine. I don't have much to say on them. For one I'm not super high on either 
of their drivers. Pierre and Ocon seem like the most consistent pairing out of this "Lower Midfield", but I'm starting to get uncomfortable with their development team. The Renault engine is meh, their aero package seems meh, and just as a cherry on top, its a mostly carbon livery.
I hate to say it but it's just hard to get excited about Alpine. Their rivals from previous years in McLaren and Aston Martin, have outpaced them in development, storylines come out about the car being hot garbage, they seem to have lost personality. Which absolutely sucks. 
Both drivers have some of the best race wins in recent history, they used to punch above their weight often and it was exciting. However after a mediocre testing, and even worse storylines surrounding thier development, I am worried about Alpine. 

# Bottom of the Barrel
# Haas-Sauber
Starting out on a positive note, Sauber. I am kind of excited for Sauber. They had decent laptimes in testing, their livery is fresh and exciting, and it feels like on a good day they can score some decent points for this team. It may be too early to say, but if one of 
these teams is going to make it out of this tier, I think it will be Sauber. I would love to see it, however the chips are definitely stacked against them. The field seems tighter, and I am definitely not confident in either of their drivers putting up good fights on track.
Unfortunately, Zhou seems too green, and it is just not Bottas' strong suit in my opinion. However this team is not dead yet and I predict a few standout performances that are going to keep this team alive. And now Haas. Ayao Komatsu can do everything he can, but this team 
just feels awful. This is quite possibly the worst team you could have gone to as a first year team principal. If he can actually get Haas running, that would be amazing to see, but similar to Sauber, it doesn't look promising. I still think Andretti should buyout Haas,
because Haas just isn't doing anything. They don't seem motivated to fight for anything, they seem fine collecting the prize money for 9th or 10th every year and just moving on, and it just feels bad. When they came in they were challengers for points. 
Now they are lucky to get more than 10 in a season. This is far and away the only team in the paddock where I have absolutely no expectations, no feelings of excitement, no feelings of disappointment. They have said that they are making steps towards their tyre degredation issues and if they can get on top of that great, but it feels like the rest of the grid will have out-developed them by the time they have deg in a good window.

# Final thoughts
As we move into a new season, the field seems to be bunching up. I know I spoke harshly about some teams before, however those same teams also have talked about having upgrades in the making, and on their way. I have a good feeling the order of the grid will be changing race by race, and while at the top, the constructors may not be the most exciting, I can almost guarantee that the fights in the middle of the pack for points is going to be fierce. I am optimistic about this season as a whole, and I believe that, with the cars getting closer, this year could be extremely exciting, especially for the midfield.
