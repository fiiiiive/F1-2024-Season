# Hamilton Victory #9 at Silverstone
This race was amazing. We got dry battles, we got wet weather running, and we got a brand new race winner in 2024. Lewis Hamilton ran an amazing race, but this race posed some interesting questions for the other 
teams. First, could Norris have won? Second, could Max have won? These questions are what I want to dive into today. 

# Norris Victory?
