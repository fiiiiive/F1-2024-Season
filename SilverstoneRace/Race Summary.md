# Hamilton Victory #9 at Silverstone
This race was amazing. We got dry battles, we got wet weather running, and we got a brand new race winner in 2024. Lewis Hamilton ran an amazing race, but this race posed some interesting questions for the other 
teams. First, could Norris have won? Second, could Max have won? These questions are what I want to dive into today. 

# Right Tyres Right Time
Looking at the RaceTrace, the Mercedes was clearly the class of the field. However, Norris was keeping pace with the Mercedes fairly well, where he ended up making a crucial pass on the Mercedes as the rain started to come down. Martin Brundle mentioned the suspension possibly being softer on the McLaren as a likely culprit, but the McLaren seemed to come alive in the rain. Softer suspension means the driver has more feel in the car, meaning that they probably had more trust on it. A stiffer suspension makes the car more stable at higher speeds, at the cost of that trust factor. On a dry track a stiffer suspension could have played well in the Mercedes hands, especially with how well their high speed cornering was Saturday. But in the rain it just made it harder to feel what the car was doing. This does lead us to a crucial part which is the Dry-Inter Crossover. This is the period where it is optimal to go into the pits to fit intermediate tyres. I believe that both the McLaren and Mercedes were one lap late to fit Intermediate tyres. Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz pit one lap earlier to make the switch and the gap that they had to the front runners dropped from ~5 seconds to ~3 seconds when it was done.

As we can see above Max Verstappen is the yellow line. The massive uptick in the graph is the pit in lap, and after one lap he has closed up about 2-3 seconds in on the front runners. However, the Red Bull was clearly lacking pace in the race compared to the others, so we can see him drop off. If a car with more pace, like the McLaren pits, I believe they would have maintained their gap, and Oscar Piastri could have pit the lap later if they did not want to double stack. This would protect Piastri, which is especially important as his race was ruined at this stop. It was very evident that he was called in way to late for Inters and his race paid the price. 

The second big moment came at the Inter-Dry Crossover on laps 39-40. Looking at the data I think that the Mercedes and Red Bull pit on an optimal lap, however for the cars going onto Mediums or Hards (especially Max) they could have gone on one lap earlier. Looking at other cars that pit one lap earlier, they immediately start punching in better lap times from the get-go. Magnussen (white), Ricciardo (grey), Leclerc (red), and Zhou (dark green) all get their tyres fired up and start putting in fast laps. The pink line is the average lap time during the race and all of them have a negative slope compared to it after they pit.

The only reason I think the leaders waited is because they had more to lose and wanted to see the data first. The time it took for the Pirelli tyres to get warmed up was very little, and so I think pitting one lap earlier would have been beneficial for the Red Bull and Mercedes. As for Norris I believe that he still would have been passed by Hamilton because of cold tyres, but I believe that he would have a better chance at fighting if he pit a lap earlier and had the time to fire up his tyres. Lastly, the mediums were absolutely the best choice to go onto during the final stint. Especially if he pits on lap 38, he has time to fire up the tyre, and with the longer life of the mediums, he is able to push until the end instead of trying to conserve the pace in the soft. With Red Bull out of fresh mediums Max was only able to go onto the hards and full push, which he showed was faster than soft-saving. If he wasn't too far away from the front runners already, he absolutely could have won this race, but I believe his pace was sorely lacking this weekend.

The McLaren however had a spare set of Mediums, and they have already shown that their car is happier with lower fuel and more worn tyres than most. If Norris pitted one lap earlier for mediums instead of softs he would have absolutely won this race, especially with Lewis having to save tyres. 

That being said Lewis absolutely deserved the win today. His racecraft and timely strategy calls were the reason that they won this race today. All of my suggestions are just that, suggestions, and so hats off to Lewis Hamilton, your 2024 British Grand Prix winner.
